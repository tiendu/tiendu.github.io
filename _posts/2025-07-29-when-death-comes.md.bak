> *"To every man upon this earth

> And how can man die better
> Than facing fearful odds,
> For the ashes of his fathers,
> And the temples of his gods?"*

This line always hits me in the gut.
I don't think it's about dying in war or glory or any of that.
To me, it’s asking something quieter:

**What would it take to live in a way that gives your death meaning?**

---

Some days, I feel like I'm just reacting.
Emails. Deadlines. Slack messages.
It's easy to fall into the rhythm of survival — and call it living.

But when things go still,
when I'm alone with my thoughts,
this one question keeps resurfacing:

> **If this was my last week, would any of this matter?**

---

I don't have dramatic answers.
But here’s what I've been holding onto lately.

### I want to stand for something - even if it's small.

Not loudly.
Not to impress.
Just something I believe in enough to keep showing up for it.
Even when no one's watching.

---

### I want to build things that last.

Not apps. Not résumés.
Moments. Trust.
Maybe even a little courage in the people around me.

---

### I want to leave clean.

I've seen how easy it is to drift -
to get stuck in jobs, roles, dynamics where you feel like a cog with a face.

I don't want that.
If I go, I want to go **mid-sentence** -
writing something, building something, loving someone properly.

---

I guess what I'm saying is:
I want to be proud of where I am **when the curtain drops.**

Not for legacy. Not for ego.
Just so that if the lights go out tomorrow,
I'd think: *"Yeah... that was worth it."*

---

That's all.

Just something I needed to write down today.
If you've ever felt this way too - I see you.
