He wakes up tired.

Not the tiredness after effort,  
but the tiredness that is already there  
before the day begins.

He works.  
He eats.  
He rests.

None of it removes the weight.

Nothing is wrong.  
Nothing is broken.  
There is only a thin, constant pressure —  
like holding something that never gets put down.

After work, he sits alone in a quiet room.  
No pain.  
No injury.  
Just an empty heaviness.

He opens his hand.  
There is nothing in it.

And yet, it feels full.

---

The next day, he carries less.

Not fewer tasks.  
Not fewer responsibilities.

Just fewer extra thoughts.

When working, he works.  
Not proving.  
Not preparing explanations.

When eating, he eats.  
Not checking messages.  
Not reviewing the day.

At first, it feels strange.  
Like forgetting something important.

Then the silence grows wider.

---

A week later, he notices something.

He is no longer measuring himself  
against invisible standards.

No audience.  
No score.

Only movement, then stillness.

Only breath, then breath again.

The tiredness does not disappear,  
but it no longer deepens.

---

Another week passes.

He wakes without urgency.  
Not excited.  
Not resisting.

Just awake.

He moves through the day  
without narrating it to himself.

No rehearsal.  
No post-mortem.

Things happen.  
Then they end.

---

It becomes clear, quietly:

Exhaustion did not come from doing too much,  
but from carrying what did not belong to the action.

Expectation.  
Comparison.  
The need to become something else  
while already being here.

These were never part of the task.

They were additions.

---

Nothing dramatic changes.

The schedule is the same.  
The work is the same.

But fewer things are being held.

And because of that,  
nothing is leaking.

Energy does not need to be created.  
When it is not wasted,  
it remains.
