title: "Bringing Pixi to Nextflow: A Smarter Way to Manage Environments"

Reproducible environments are a cornerstone of modern bioinformatics workflows - and while **Conda** has long been the default in Nextflow pipelines, it's not without challenges: slow environment resolution, inconsistent lockfile behavior, and bloated specs. Enter **Pixi**, a fast, modern, and TOML-based package and environment manager developed by [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev/).

Pixi builds on the **conda-forge** and **bioconda** ecosystems, but implements its **own dependency resolver written in Rust** for lightning-fast solves. It offers a structured, developer-friendly approach to managing environments. With a single `pixi.toml` file, you define dependencies, platforms, tasks, and even multi-environment matrices - all version-locked and reproducible via `pixi.lock`.

However, unlike Conda, **Pixi is not yet a first-class citizen in Nextflow's DSL** - meaning you can't simply use a `pixi` directive inside your `process` blocks.

**But that doesn't mean you can't use it.** This post shows how to integrate Pixi seamlessly into your Nextflow workflows using a combination of smart `beforeScript` hooks and lightweight configuration - giving you all the benefits of Pixi without waiting on native support.

## üß™ A Minimal Pixi + Nextflow Example

Let's test it with a simple process that runs `samtools --version`.

### üßæ Step 1: Define `pixi.toml`

```toml
[project]
name = "test-pixi-env"

channels = ["conda-forge", "bioconda"]
platforms = ["linux-64"]

[dependencies]
samtools = "*"
```

### üß¨ Step 2: Create `main.nf`

```nextflow
process check_pixi_tool {
  label 'pixi'

  output:
  path 'version.txt'

  script:
  """
  samtools --version > version.txt
  """
}

workflow {
  check_pixi_tool()
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure `nextflow.config`

```
params.pixi_env = './pixi.toml'

process {
  withLabel: 'pixi' {
    beforeScript = '''
    [ -d .pixi ] && [ -f pixi.lock ] || pixi install
    eval "$(pixi shell-hook)"
    '''
  }
}
```

This script:

- Checks if Pixi has already installed the environment (via `.pixi` and `pixi.lock`)
- Runs `pixi install` only if needed
- Activates the environment via `pixi shell-hook`

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploying to AWS Batch

If you're planning to use Pixi on AWS Batch, the key requirement is ensuring that your compute environment or container image includes Pixi itself - since Nextflow does not manage that installation for you.

‚úÖ Requirements:

- ‚úÖ Pixi installed (e.g., via `curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash`)
- ‚úÖ A `pixi.toml` file available inside the container or synced at runtime
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `nextflow.config` must reference the correct path to `pixi.toml` relative to the work directory

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Install Pixi
RUN curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

# Add Pixi to PATH
ENV PATH="/root/.pixi/bin:$PATH"

# Copy environment file (optional - you may also pull from S3)
COPY pixi.toml /workspace/pixi.toml
WORKDIR /workspace
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: In cloud environments like AWS Batch, you'll likely need to make sure that `params.pixi_env` in `nextflow.config` resolves to the correct location inside the container (e.g., `/workspace/pixi.toml` or `"$PWD/pixi.toml"` depending on mount context).

## Summary

| Feature | Pixi Support with Nextflow |
| --- | --- |
| Local development | ‚úÖ Full support via beforeScript |
| Dynamic install | ‚úÖ Conditional logic included |
| AWS Batch | ‚úÖ With prebuilt container |
| Native DSL syntax | ‚ùå Not supported (no pixi directive yet) |

## üí¨ Final Thoughts

Pixi offers a lightweight, predictable, and developer-friendly way to manage environments - without the overhead often associated with Conda. While it isn't yet supported as a native DSL directive in Nextflow, this guide shows how easy it is to integrate Pixi into your pipelines today using simple configuration patterns.

Whether you're exploring reproducibility on your laptop or scaling to AWS Batch, **Pixi + Nextflow** is a powerful and modern combination worth trying.
