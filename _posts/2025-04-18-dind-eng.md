As containerized development becomes the standard, the idea of running Docker _inside_ Docker‚Äîknown as **DinD**-has gained popularity, especially in CI/CD pipelines and test environments. But with great power comes great responsibility.

In this post, we‚Äôll explore:
- What is DinD?
- Why do people use it?
- What are the pros and cons?
- What are the risks-with code examples
- And how Podman can solve many of these problems

## üîç What is Docker-in-Docker?

**Docker-in-Docker (DinD)** refers to running a Docker daemon inside a Docker container. This is often done in two ways:
- **Full DinD**: Start a new dockerd daemon inside a container.
- **Docker socket mount**: Mount the host Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) and reuse the host's Docker engine from within a container.
