title: "RoL-Based Alpha: A Simple Financial Ratio That Outsmarts the Big Players"

Can a simple ratio expose under-the-radar companies that use debt more efficiently than industry giants?

In this post, I'll introduce **RoL (Return on Liabilities)** - a practical, underrated metric to spot hidden alpha. It's fast, simple, and brutally honest about one thing:

> "Can you turn borrowed money into real profit?"

## üí° The Core Idea: Return on Liabilities (RoL)

Most traditional metrics like **ROE**, **ROA**, or **EBITDA margin** focus on profitability in relation to assets or equity. But what if we flip the lens?

What if we ask:

> "For every dollar of debt a company holds, how much net profit does it actually generate?"

That's the essence of RoL:

**RoL = Net_Profit / Total_Liabilities**

Or for a cleaner version:

**RoL_EBIT = EBIT / Financial_Debt**

## üìà Why RoL Works

| Advantage | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Cuts through accounting tricks | Profit vs debt is harder to manipulate |
| Filters out "zombie companies" | If you're borrowing money and not making money, you fail |
| Finds capital-efficient businesses | RoL rewards companies who *use debt wisely* |
| Helps avoid empty high-ROE traps | Some high-ROE firms simply have no debt - but that's not always a strength |

## üß† Turning RoL Into a Stock Screener

### Step 1: Pick an Industry

Let's say: *Vietnamese Fertilizer Industry*

(Example: DPM, DCM, LAS,‚Ä¶)

### Step 2: Find the Top 10 Companies by Revenue

These are your "Big Players."

Calculate **RoL_avg_top** = average RoL of this group.

### Step 3: Compare Every Other Company Against It

If a smaller company has:

- **RoL > RoL_avg_top**
- **Stable or growing RoL trend over 3+ quarters**
- **Manageable financial debt (not exploding)**

Then you've found an **undervalued alpha candidate**.

---

## üéØ The Underdog Advantage

Smaller companies with high RoL outperforming industry average are like **"leverage ninjas"** - they quietly use debt more efficiently than the giants, yet remain underpriced because no one's watching them.

It's not about "zero debt" being safe.

It's about: **"If I borrow, do I multiply it into value?"**

---

## üìä How to Visualize It

- Plot RoL (quarterly) over 5 years
- Compare with industry average
- Highlight turning points (e.g. when company begins using debt)

**Bonus:** Create `RoL_rel = RoL / RoL_avg_top` 

- If `RoL_rel > 1`: Outperforming average  
- If `RoL_rel > 2`: Potential mispricing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Net profit manipulation | Use EBIT or CFO as fallback |
| Liabilities include non-financial debt | Focus on financial debt only |
| Low-debt companies create "fake" RoL spikes | Exclude firms with negligible debt (<5% assets) |
| Liquidity issues in small-cap stocks | Check trading volume before acting |

## üß© Final Thoughts

> In a world obsessed with massive balance sheets and high ROE, the real edge may lie in simplicity.

RoL doesn't tell you *everything* - but it tells you one thing **very clearly**:

> "Are you good at turning other people's money into profit?"

If the answer is "yes" - and no one else has noticed yet - you might just have found your next alpha.
