I used to be afraid of being average.

Not failing. Not collapsing. Just… being ordinary.

The kind of person who doesn’t stand out. Doesn’t dominate. Doesn’t become exceptional in any obvious way.

That fear shaped more of my life than I like to admit. Growing up, I absorbed the idea that everyone is special, that potential must always expand, that standing still is the same as falling behind. So I kept trying to reinvent myself — new skills, new directions, new ambitions — as if identity required constant upgrades.

Standing still felt dangerous.

Because standing still looked like mediocrity.

But over time, I’ve started to suspect that the real problem was never average itself — but the world we measure ourselves against.

Immanuel Kant never left his hometown. He walked the same streets, followed the same routines, lived a life that looked painfully ordinary from the outside. And yet from that repetition came ideas that reshaped philosophy for centuries. He didn’t chase novelty. He stayed long enough for depth to emerge.

Today, staying looks like stagnation.

We live in an age of exposure. We don’t compare ourselves to our neighbors anymore — we compare ourselves to the most exceptional people on the planet. Founders, prodigies, traders, athletes, polymaths. The brain doesn’t understand statistical rarity. It assumes whatever appears frequently is normal.

So extraordinary begins to look like baseline.

And ordinary begins to feel like failure.

We are drowning in examples of extreme outcomes.

We are also drowning in information.

Books, podcasts, frameworks, productivity systems. Reading more is celebrated. Learning more is praised. Knowing more feels like progress.

But there is a difference between consuming ideas and being shaped by them.

Reading fifty books once may expand vocabulary.  
Reading five books twenty times may reshape how you think.

The modern world rewards exposure. Depth requires repetition.

And repetition looks average.

Sitting with the same problem for years looks average.  
Maintaining the same system reliably looks average.  
Refining the same craft quietly looks average.

But refinement is where mastery lives.

In Japanese culture, there is a deep respect for incremental perfection — doing the same thing again and again until reliability becomes almost invisible. The Shinkansen high-speed train is famous not for dramatic breakthroughs but for decades of obsessive refinement, extraordinary punctuality, and an almost unimaginable safety record. Thousands of ordinary workers maintaining small details every day make that possible.

No viral moments. No heroic narratives.

Just systems that work.

The same is true in technology. Somewhere, a sysadmin spends years learning obscure details about logs, backups, kernels, network edge cases. Nobody celebrates it publicly. Nobody writes headlines about uptime. But when things don’t fail, nobody notices — and that silence is the proof of mastery.

Reliability is rarely exciting.

But reliability is civilization.

And here is the strange contradiction of the modern world:

We publicly worship novelty.

But privately, we depend on stability.

We celebrate disruption, innovation, reinvention. We share stories about genius and breakthroughs. But the systems we trust most are the ones that behave predictably. The planes that land safely. The trains that arrive on time. The infrastructure that does not surprise us.

The people who maintain those systems often look average.

But without them, nothing works.

Instead, many of us skim. We pivot. We sample endlessly. We collect intellectual souvenirs without staying long enough for anything to transform us. We become wide but thin — exposed to everything, grounded in nothing.

Which feeds the fear of being average.

There’s another layer to this fear: we are often afraid of futures that almost never happen.

We imagine irrelevance. Replacement. Collapse. Being left behind by faster, smarter, younger people. We simulate catastrophic timelines in our heads and treat them as probabilities.

But most lives do not collapse dramatically.

They unfold slowly.

Most feared outcomes never materialize in the extreme form we imagine. Yet we live reacting to those hypotheticals, chasing constant reinvention as proof that we are not average.

Maybe the quiet truth is this:

What looks average from the outside is often just depth in progress.

A cron job running reliably every day is not impressive. But systems fail without it.

A farmer planting the same field each season is not exceptional. But food appears because of it.

A train arriving exactly on time is not exciting. But entire societies depend on that precision.

Maybe the real danger is not being average.

Maybe the danger is never staying long enough anywhere — in a place, a discipline, a book, a craft — for something uncommon to grow.

I still hear the old fear sometimes: What if this is all I am?

But when I sit with that question longer, I realize something uncomfortable.

The fear was never really about being average.

It was about being unseen.

About living a life that doesn’t draw applause.  
About building something that no one celebrates.  
About doing work that functions so well it becomes invisible.

We say we want to be exceptional.

But often what we really want is to be noticed.

And there is nothing wrong with that. It is human.

Yet the systems we trust most — the ones that carry us safely, feed us reliably, connect us quietly — are built by people whose names we will never know.

Their work disappears into function.

Their excellence hides inside normality.

Maybe maturity is realizing that meaning does not require recognition.

Maybe depth does not require spectacle.

Maybe a life can be profound without being loud.

If I show up.
If I go deep instead of wide.
If I refine instead of constantly reinvent.
If I build something slowly and keep building it —

And if nobody claps —

Maybe that does not make it average.

Maybe that makes it real.

And maybe that is enough.
