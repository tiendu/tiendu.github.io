I used to be afraid of being average.

Not failing. Not collapsing. Just… being ordinary.

The kind of person who doesn’t stand out. Doesn’t dominate. Doesn’t become exceptional in any obvious way.

That fear shaped more of my life than I like to admit. As a kid, I absorbed the idea that everyone is special. That potential must be maximized. That standing still is the same as falling behind. So I tried to reinvent myself constantly — new skills, new directions, new ambitions — as if identity were something that needed annual upgrades.

Standing still felt dangerous.

Because standing still looked like mediocrity.

But over time, I’ve started to wonder whether the real problem was never average itself — but the world we measure ourselves against.

In Kant’s case, he never left his hometown. He lived in the same place his entire life, walked the same streets, kept the same routines. From the outside, it looked painfully ordinary. And yet from that repetition came ideas that reshaped philosophy for centuries. He didn’t chase novelty. He stayed long enough for depth to emerge.

Today, staying looks like stagnation.

We live in an age of exposure. We don’t compare ourselves to our village anymore — we compare ourselves to the most exceptional people on the planet. Founders, prodigies, investors, athletes, polymaths. The brain doesn’t understand statistical rarity. It interprets frequent exposure as normal. So extraordinary begins to look like baseline.

And ordinary begins to feel like failure.

We are drowning in examples of extreme outcomes.

At the same time, we are drowning in information.

Books, podcasts, frameworks, productivity systems, career strategies. We are encouraged to consume endlessly. Reading more is celebrated. Learning more is praised. Knowing more feels like progress.

But there is a difference between consuming ideas and being shaped by them.

Reading fifty books once may expand vocabulary.  
Reading five books twenty times may reshape how you think.

The modern world rewards exposure. Depth requires repetition.

And repetition looks average.

Sitting with the same problem for years looks average.  
Maintaining the same system reliably looks average.  
Refining the same craft quietly looks average.

But that is how mastery compounds.

Instead, we skim. We pivot. We sample. We collect intellectual souvenirs from everywhere. And because we never stay long enough in one place — geographically, intellectually, professionally — we never feel deep. We feel broad and thin.

Which feeds the fear of being average.

There’s another layer to this fear: we are often afraid of futures that almost never happen.

We imagine irrelevance. Replacement. Collapse. Being left behind by faster, smarter, younger people. We simulate catastrophic timelines in our heads and treat them as probabilities.

But most lives do not collapse dramatically.

They unfold slowly.

Most careers are not destroyed by sudden irrelevance. They drift, adjust, adapt. Most people are not replaced overnight. Most feared outcomes never materialize in the extreme form we imagine.

Yet we live reacting to those hypotheticals.

So we chase more knowledge. More reinvention. More proof that we are not average.

Maybe the quiet truth is this:

What looks average from the outside is often just depth in progress.

A cron job running reliably every day is not impressive. But systems fail without it.

A farmer planting the same field each season is not exceptional. But food appears because of it.

A philosopher walking the same streets every afternoon is not adventurous. But ideas mature because he stays.

Maybe the real danger is not being average.

Maybe the danger is never staying long enough anywhere — in a place, a discipline, a book, a craft — for something uncommon to grow.

I still hear the old fear sometimes: What if this is all I am?

But now the question feels different.

If I show up.  
If I go deep instead of wide.  
If I choose repetition over spectacle.  
If I build something slowly and keep building it —

And if that life looks ordinary from the outside —

Maybe that is not mediocrity.

Maybe that is just how depth looks before it is recognized.

And maybe that is enough.
