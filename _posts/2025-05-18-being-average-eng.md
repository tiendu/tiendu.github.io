Let me start with this: I've always feared being average.  
Or more precisely, discovering that I'm nothing more than average.

That fear was one of the biggest undercurrents of my childhood. I grew up with the weighty promise that each of us is *special*. During my teenage years, I believed I had to outgrow myself every year. Reinvent. Evolve. Become someone new — *year after year*.

The thought of standing still terrified me. I believed that if I ever stopped transforming, I would slip into quiet irrelevance.

And to my younger self, there was nothing more tragic.

It has taken me years to unlearn that belief.

## The Man Who Never Left

There’s a story about Immanuel Kant.

Kant lived his entire life in Königsberg. He rarely traveled more than a few miles from his home. The townspeople supposedly set their clocks by his afternoon walks. From the outside, his life looked almost painfully ordinary: same town, same routines, same streets.

And yet, from that small, repetitive life came ideas that reshaped philosophy for centuries.

He did not chase spectacle.  
He did not travel the world.  
He did not reinvent himself every year.

He stayed.

And from staying, he built depth.

That story unsettles me in a good way. Because it suggests something radical:

You do not need a dramatic life to build meaningful ideas.

## On the Sidelines

Looking back, I think I developed an aversion to competition early on.

School already carried the pressure of high performance — and it was never subtle. If you underperformed, you knew. They told your parents. They ranked you publicly. They compared you to the top student.

You were always being measured.

Adding more — sports, games, extracurriculars — felt unbearable. So I opted out.

I stayed on the sidelines.

Back then, I told myself I just wasn’t interested. But the truth? I was scared.

Scared that if I tried and still blended into the crowd, it would confirm what I feared most:

That I was just average.

The fear followed me into adulthood. In a world obsessed with top performers, being average feels dangerous. Average means replaceable. Average means first in line when cuts come.

Average means invisible.

## The Myth of Constant Greatness

But history is strange.

Marcus Aurelius — emperor of Rome — wrote some of the most enduring reflections on humility and duty. Yet he constantly reminded himself that he was just a man doing his role for a brief moment in time. He did not talk about greatness. He talked about responsibility. About showing up.

The world celebrates the peak moments. The coronations. The keynotes. The viral launches.

But most civilizations were not built by peak moments.

They were built by repetition.

Farmers planting again.  
Craftsmen refining slowly.  
Engineers maintaining systems that nobody notices — until they break.

Most lives are not fireworks. They are steady flames.

## From a Developer’s Desk

In tech, the pressure to be exceptional is relentless.

New frameworks every month.  
New paradigms every quarter.  
The silent expectation that if you’re not shipping a side project at midnight, you’re falling behind.

But think about the tools that quietly run the world:

`rsync`  
`awk`  
`cron`

They are not glamorous. They do not trend. You will not see conference talks about how sexy they are.

They just work.

They do one thing well.  
And they keep doing it.

Day after day.

Sometimes I wonder — what if being that kind of person is enough?

Maybe I won’t build a unicorn startup.  
Maybe I won’t give a keynote.  
Maybe my name won’t circulate in the industry.

But maybe I can be the `cron` job in someone’s system —  
quietly reliable, predictable, steady.

Not flashy.

Just solid.

## Redefining Growth

I used to believe growth meant transformation. That every year required a new version of myself.

Now, growth feels different.

It feels like refinement.  
Like sanding down rough edges instead of changing shapes entirely.  
Like deepening roots rather than stretching branches wildly in all directions.

Kant stayed in his hometown.  
Many monks stay in one monastery their entire lives.  
Some engineers maintain the same system for a decade — and that system feeds millions.

There is a quiet dignity in consistency.

## Embracing the Ordinary

If you have ever feared being average, you are not alone.

But maybe average is not the insult we think it is.

Average can mean stable.  
It can mean reliable.  
It can mean grounded.

In a culture addicted to peaks, valleys are treated as failures. But valleys are where rivers form.

Maybe the goal was never to be exceptional by the world's definition.

Maybe the real goal is to be authentic — to live a life that is yours, not someone else’s highlight reel.

To show up.  
To build.  
To care.  
To improve — slowly, quietly, steadily.

That kind of life may not trend.

But it sustains.

And maybe — just maybe —

That is enough.
