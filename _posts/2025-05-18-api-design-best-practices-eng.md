REST APIs are the connective tissue of modern systems ‚Äî especially when you're building tools that others will build on. Whether you're exposing models in production, querying genomic metadata, or orchestrating workflows from the CLI, a good API can be the difference between smooth automation and brittle chaos.

GraphQL is often pitched as a modern alternative to REST ‚Äî and it does solve real pain points like over-fetching and schema introspection. But when your priority is **reliability, simplicity, and ease of debugging**, REST remains the most dependable option. REST embraces HTTP conventions, works out of the box with tools like `curl`, proxies, and caching layers, and is easier to reason about in high-throughput, distributed systems.

This post is my personal checklist ‚Äî grounded in real-world reliability ‚Äî for designing REST APIs that don't break when your team scales, your users misbehave, or your future self forgets how it works.

## üß± Design Principles Backed by SOLID

Reliable REST APIs follow the same principles that make software maintainable:

### Single Responsibility
  
Every endpoint should do *just one thing*. No side effects, no "magic."  

‚úÖ `POST /users` creates a user ‚Äî and nothing else.

### Open/Closed Principle

Design for **extension**, not modification.  

Version your APIs. Don't break old contracts to add new features.

### Stable Interfaces

Don't surprise clients by changing field types or removing keys.

Add optional fields instead of changing existing ones.

### Explicit Contracts

Hide internals. Don't expose raw database models or internal logic in responses.

---

## üîë REST API Practices That Actually Matter

### 1. Keep URLs Resource-Oriented

Use nouns:

```http
GET /users/42
POST /runs
DELETE /runs/88
```

Avoid verbs in routes. Let HTTP verbs define the action.

Use plural nouns for collections:

- ‚úÖ `/users`, `/orders`, `/runs`  
- ‚úÖ `/users/123/runs`  
- ‚ùå `/userList`, `/createUserEntry`

Plural resources are the convention and make routes predictable.

---

### 2. Use Query Parameters for Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination

```http
GET /runs?status=completed&sort=created_at&page=2&limit=50
```

Use these for:

- Filtering: `?status=active`
- Sorting: `?sort=-created_at`
- Pagination: `?page=3&limit=20`

---

### 3. Use Status Codes to Reflect Reality

Let HTTP speak for your API:

- `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content`
- `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`, `409 Conflict`
- `500 Internal Server Error`

Clients shouldn't need to parse your error strings to guess what happened.

---

### 4. Design Consistent JSON Responses

‚úÖ Good:

```json
{
  "data": {...},
  "error": null
}
```

‚ùå Bad:

```json
"Operation completed successfully"
```

Structured responses are easier to handle in any client, language, or logging system.

---

### 5. Be Idempotent Where It Counts

APIs must survive retries:

- `DELETE /users/123` ‚Äî safe to call twice
- `POST /charges` ‚Äî use an `Idempotency-Key` header so repeated requests return the same result without re-processing

Idempotency isn't optional ‚Äî it's a survival strategy.

---

### 6. Secure by Default

Security isn't optional ‚Äî especially for public or internal APIs handling sensitive data.

- Always use **HTTPS**
- Use **OAuth2** or **JWT Bearer Tokens**
- Never pass sensitive data in query params (e.g., passwords, API keys)

üí° _Design your API assuming it will be misused._

---

### 7. Version Early, Version Clearly

APIs evolve ‚Äî your users shouldn't suffer for that.

- Use URI versioning: `/v1/users`, `/v2/orders`
- Avoid breaking changes
- If needed, support older versions in parallel

Good versioning makes APIs resilient and predictable.

---

### 8. Rate Limit and Fail Gracefully

APIs under load fail. The question is **how** they fail.

- Set rate limits and communicate them:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`
  - `Retry-After`
- Return `429 Too Many Requests` when appropriate

Graceful degradation builds trust.

---

### 9. Document for Humans

If you need a meeting to explain your API, it's not ready.

- Use OpenAPI/Swagger
- Provide curl examples
- Keep it in sync with the code

Good docs reduce support requests and human error.

---

## üß† Final Thoughts

You don't need 20 rules to design a reliable API. You just need to keep it:

- Predictable
- Purposeful
- Clear to humans

REST may not be shiny, but it wins by being boring ‚Äî and boring is exactly what you want when things go wrong at scale.

Design like you'll need to debug it at 3 AM. You probably will.
